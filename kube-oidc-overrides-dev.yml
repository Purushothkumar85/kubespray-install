          # Legacy 'org' field. 'org' and 'orgs' cannot be used simultaneously. A user
          # MUST be a member of the following org to authenticate with dex.
          # org: my-organization
          #
          # Dex queries the following organizations for group information if the
          # "groups" scope is provided. Group claims are formatted as "(org):(team)".
          # For example if a user is part of the "engineering" team of the "coreos"
          # org, the group claim would include "coreos:engineering".
          #
          # If orgs are specified in the config then user MUST be a member of at least one of the specified orgs to
          # authenticate with dex.
          #
          # If neither 'org' nor 'orgs' are specified in the config and 'loadAllGroups' setting set to true then user
          # authenticate with ALL user's Github groups. Typical use case for this setup:
          # provide read-only access to everyone and give full permissions if user has 'my-organization:admins-team' group claim.  
          orgs:
          - name: kumulus-technologies
            teams:
            - developers

          # Optional choice between 'name' (default), 'slug', or 'both'.
          #
          # As an example, group claims for member of 'Site Reliability Engineers' in
          # Acme organization would yield:
          #   - ['acme:Site Reliability Engineers'] for 'name'
          #   - ['acme:site-reliability-engineers'] for 'slug'
          #   - ['acme:Site Reliability Engineers', 'acme:site-reliability-engineers'] for 'both'
